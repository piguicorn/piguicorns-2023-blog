The intention for this blog is to become a journal but above all, a commitment. 

I have been wanting to pursue the goal of writing regularly for a long time, but there was always an excuse my impostor syndrome or the procrastinator inside me found to postpone it. My posts will never be good enough or no one will read them,  were some of the ideas coming to my mind. 

Besides, I am aware my questionable English skills can lead to many grammar mistakes. But this is one of the many reasons to write: improving my ability to communicate.  

Another important reason is to summarize, emphasize and share what I will be learning during my challenge "100 Days of Ally" and, hopefully, it will inspire others to write their own blogs or learn about accessibility too.

Are we ready? Let's get started! ðŸš€
