Web Accessibility increases the diversity of users navigating a website, which can lead to the terms inclusivity and accessibility (sometimes even usability) being used interchangeably. 

While it's true that an accessible web is more inclusive, the goals in Inclusive Design (also known as Universal Design) go beyond people with disabilities. 

Inclusive Design will have in mind people with different abilities, but also language, economic backgrounds, education, geographic location, age, gender, etc.
